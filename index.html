   <p>
     1.If you want to post comments online, you don’t have to use your own name. Invent a nickname to use instead. You can also use a picture instead of a real photo.
     2.Review and adjust the privacy settings on your social media and online accounts to control who can see your information.
     3.Don’t tell anyone your passwords and don’t write them down in an obvious place. Make them more complex by using a combination of letters, numbers and punctuation marks.
     4.Protect your identity online. Be careful about who you share personal information with and always think  before sharing details like your email, home address, school or phone number with someone.
     5. Don`t upload your photos to social networks, this is dangerous because it will take away our privacy and we will be exposed, we will give information about where we are or our body to other people.   </p>
